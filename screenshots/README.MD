# Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots from the **lab.local** Active Directory homelab.

The screenshots are used to visually support the documentation and demonstrate:
- Proper Active Directory organizational unit (OU) structure
- Use of security groups for role-based access
- Clean handling of disabled user and computer accounts

Only minimal screenshots are included to keep the repository clean, readable, and recruiter-friendly.
